I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be snippets of HTML and CSS code with some random words and does not contain meaningful information to create multiple-choice questions. 

To generate relevant MCQs, please provide a coherent and informative text. 

For example, you could provide:
* An excerpt from a history book
* A paragraph about a scientific concept
* A summary of a news article 

Once you provide me with suitable text, I will be happy to help you generate MCQs.
